1. Geometry description

 The geometry was constructed by the draft of Varian.

2. Physics processes

 PhysicsList.cc defines low energy EM model (Livermore), photonuclear reactions and hadron reactions with HP neutron.

3. Event generation

 Event generation has 2 types. One is from initial electrons with variation of spot size and kinetic energy.
Another is from Phase Spase file with position, direction, kinetic energy and particel definition.

4. main()

 In main(), definition of arguments. First argument is main function itseld, and second one is macro file.
If you don't input macro file, vis.mac will be adopted. Third argument is random seed. If you don't input 3rd argument, seed will be generated by system time.
